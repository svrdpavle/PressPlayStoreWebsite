He had left a happy family and farm home of 22 horses, 13 cows, 3 pigs and a duckbill platypus to make his name in the world. Arriving in the UK, he loved the people, ever changing weather, mediocre football but most importantly, cinema.</p>

        <p>Over time, the rise of streaming services and DVDs hurt the business but a die hard group of VHS enthusiasts kept the business alive and would become the main customer base for Press Play.
